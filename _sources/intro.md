# PHY11006 - Quantum Physics

## Introduction
This course will introduce the motivations for quantum physics and cover the basics of realistic calculations using quantum mechanics (QM). Topics covered include:

* The Photoelectric effect;
* The Compton effect
* Thermal electromagnetic radiation from atoms;
* Line spectra and the Bohr model of the atom;
* De Br&ouml;glie (matter) waves;
* The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation for the one-dimensional infinite potential well;
* The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal.

These notes do not include everything that is covered in the lectures, however they do summarise all the key information which might be covered in the exam at the end of the semester. Please augment these notes with the lecture slides to help you understand the points covered here.
